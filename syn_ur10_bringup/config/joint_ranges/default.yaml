# default.yaml
# Specifies the upper and lower limits of ur10 joints in the urdf.
# Default limits are 2.0 * pi = 6.2831853 for all joints except
# for elbow_joint. elbow_joint is restricted to +/-pi due to hardware
# limitations.
#
# Limits that align with the robots joint limits (+/- 2*pi) may allow
# joint configurations that lead to protective stop.
# To prevent that we substract a safety tolerance of 0.002.
